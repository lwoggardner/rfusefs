# rfusefs - DEPRECATED
===============

### DEPRECATED

This gem exists and is maintained for backwards compatibility only.

Existing RFuse filesystems are recommended to refactor to depend directly on
[ffi_libfuse](http://rubygems.org/gems/ffi-libfuse) which supports Fuse 3 and Macfuse

---------------

## DESCRIPTION

RFuseFS is a port of the [FuseFS](http://rubygems.org/gems/fusefs/) library
aimed at allowing Ruby programmers to quickly and easily create virtual
filesystems with little more than a few lines of code.

RFuseFS is api compatible with FuseFS (0.7.0)

## REQUIREMENTS:

*   FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.net) (>= 2.8)
*   Ruby (>= 2.7)
*   rfuse (~> 2.0)
